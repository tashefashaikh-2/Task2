**Superstore Sales Dashboard – Power BI**
I created a Power BI dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales, profit, customer segments, and discount impact.

**Dashboard Pages**
Page 1: Sales & Profit Overview
Page 2: Customer & Segment Insights
Page 3: Summary & Recommendations

**Key Insights**
Technology is the top-performing category
Tables & Bookcases show negative profit
Consumer segment contributes the most sales
Sales increased from 2015 to 2017
Higher discounts reduce profit
